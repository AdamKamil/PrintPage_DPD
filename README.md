# PrintPage_DPD
Simple console app to print any web-page.
Using mostly for DPD to get information about status of parcels. Useful when your business have many shipping.
App made in C++.


All Code copied from CodeBlocks.


How it's works?

Apllication using **Headless Chrome** to print page to pdf. 
Just add a link to the page you want to print and enter it in the program.

Currently app set up to https://tracktrace.dpd.com.pl/parcelDetails?p1=XXXXXXXXX , to making many pdf's if you have only list of parcels.
**If you need to change this, you must edit DPDlink.txt**


Next step of this code is change this to the web app with user friendly look.
